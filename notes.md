# Prof. Tung and Prof. Di,

Basemaps plotting 
check how long it takes top plot
get the precipitation pretrained afno model

maijda


# datetime param, added ics



# meeting with Prof. Tung  Oct 31

ECMWF github invitation (only read) for numerical simulation for climate

Take the course to business  purdue.edu/playtimepractice/paycontractdates/aycontractbi.php
# Please take the training for FERPA and pass the quiz
# check how long does it take to run FourcastNet using CPU only on both anvil and gilbreth
# no slurm material




# westwood lecture, gis day, allenai monitoriung, dubai ml team MBUZAi, 




# 7th november

# cropping North american midwest results
# inference labelling frames with datetime
# data assimmilation for scaling across more finer scale dataset for climateCx



# 14th November
# check n_ics, decorrelation_time,  and why number_of_samples_per_year is different from 1336 to 1460
# convert to real time output for predicted_frames

# gradient of pressure can be a good attribution soource in general for weather patterns, any region with high gradient, sea surface level pressure having high gradients quite useful, winds from from dry to wet, certain wave properties change, in physical science high gradient is a cause for interest. Topography, sudden rise and fall, it will influence a lot of air possible being lifeten causing rain, elevation when falls, it becomes dry. 
# precipitation along the upwind side, just the dry on the downward side.


# the tropics have very strong signal, does not mean that most rain which is important is in tropics.  arctics water vapour is radiationally importatnt, arctic amplificatioon, gradient used for calculation matters a lot. standardize
